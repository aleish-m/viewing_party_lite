        in 1986, Aki Kaurismaki''s <i>Varjoja paratiisissa</i> (Shadows in Paradise)
        is one of the Finnish filmmaker''s earliest efforts, and it stands as one
        of the most idiosyncratic romantic comedies of all time. The painfully shy
        Nikander (Matti Pellonpää), a garbage man, means the moody Ilona, a supermarket
        checkout girl. The film tracks their bumbling attempt to establish a lasting
        relationship: dates that end as soon as they''ve begun, a romantic getaway
        where they each retreat to separate hotel rooms, and rare conversations which
        employ the absolute bare minimum of words. Nikander''s best and only friend
        Melartin (Sakari Kuosmanen), whom the garbage man only recently met through
        a spell in jail, gives some needed encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe film''s soundtrack
        is rooted in early rock-and-roll, though unlike later Kaurismaki films where
        the characters seem to be living in a 1950s bubble, all the action takes place
        in contemporary Helsinki. I''ve criticized Kaurismaki''s vision of Finland
        in other films, but <i>Varjoja paratiisissa</i> does, in my opinion, accurately
        depict the collection of gloomy, taciturn binge drinkers that are the Finns.\r\n\r\n<i>Varjoja
        paratiisissa</i> is an early work and doesn''t show the confidence of later
        efforts, but it''s still quite entertaining, its leads and their struggles
        extremely charming, and I would recommend the film. Certainly the performances
        of Pellonpää (in a typical Pellonpää role) and Outinen (who seemingly reinvents
        herself in every film) will prove quite memorable.","created_at":"2018-09-06T19:31:51.288Z","id":"5b9180a7c3a3687adc005547","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:12.193Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b9180a7c3a3687adc005547"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}'
