        another super-sized Marvel Comics superhero saga hits the big screen with
        the selected savior Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee.
        Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives
        on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful
        spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout
        the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on
        the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious
        and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over
        the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed
        and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess,
        **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions
        of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by
        two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert
        Downey Jr.’s Iron Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo
        were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise
        to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more
        treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing
        the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed
        festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil
        War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis
        flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what has caused
        the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the
        world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral
        damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus
        the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers.
        Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda
        Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that
        caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head
        honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets
        in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority
        want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the
        Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll
        when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading
        the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary
        of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored
        by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes
        that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being
        placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic
        duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth
        confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor
        Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree
        that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers.
        Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother
        (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during
        an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision
        to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with
        Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision
        (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America,
        he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers
        that want to scrutinize the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America
        firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn
        top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious
        mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying
        to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan)
        who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s
        innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come
        with more baggage attached to him–mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo
        (Daniel Bruhl).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus
        and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous “Captain America: Winter
        Soldier”) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and
        effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous
        blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works
        far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic
        Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary
        of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their
        hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put
        on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive
        to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors
        not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table.
        It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our
        heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely
        destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
        movie’s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings
        especially when a who’s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray
        at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes
        of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner),
        Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman).
        No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad
        for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive
        arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’s steady and charismatic Captain
        America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title
        one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that
        lifts the profile of Evans’s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative
        big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for
        Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the
        slick and resourceful Black Panther.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, **Captain America: Civil
        War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers
        for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen
        Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Captain

        heroes're divided and so the fans!**\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore watching this I thought
        what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once
        I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain
        America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally
        inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked
        it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war
        within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration
        they want to come under.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think they have heard that people's
        complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing
        up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that
        is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing
        the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad
        guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation
        of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining
        about that be happy?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know, but as an entertaining film,
        it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and
        posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take
        a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would
        feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously
        Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United
        States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not
        like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope
        the fans won't take it seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n_8/10_\",\"created_at\":\"2016-10-04T20:21:05.083Z\",\"id\":\"57f40f319251417fe300171a\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-06-23T15:57:51.523Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/57f40f319251417fe300171a\"},{\"author\":\"Per

        I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not
        like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one
        star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want my
        heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong
        foot right away by not only “incriminating” the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit
        politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make
        matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the United
        Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie
        right away for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I though that it could not get any worse
        it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and
        fight among themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe few redeeming qualities of this movie is
        great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time
        to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided
        and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically
        there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the
        filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story
        however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I

        long form review originally posted in 2016</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s commonplace
        for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a
        movie, that’s particularly true of MCU, and even more so of this particular
        film. That all said, here is my initial reaction to _Captain America: Civil
        War_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is often the case, it’s hard to write down too comprehensive
        a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free, so
        for starters, I’ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from
        about five minutes in to _Civil War_: I want to know how it is that two guys
        who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things, manage to
        direct action this spectacularly? Honestly. It’s insane.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Winter
        Soldier_ is one of the strongest MCU films in my opinion, and just like that
        felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior _Captain America_ film and
        the prior _Avengers_ film, _Civil War_ feels the same, but for the sequels
        to said films (_Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_). That said, it might
        lean a little too far on to the side of _Avengers_-sequel, and a little too
        light on the _Cap_-sequel. If you had to pick a lead here, it would be Steve
        Rogers, no mistake, but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad
        brush of characterisation to be solely a “_Captain America_” movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering
        the sheer scope of the piece, it’s amazing that the Russo brothers managed
        to get the ball rolling on _Civil War_ as well as they did. Even so, there
        are a couple of roles I felt could have been cut altogether without really
        impacting the story, and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some
        underrepresented puzzle pieces. Perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack
        of inclusion in others is because of plans for future MCU films (though certainly
        not all instances can use that excuse) but either way, if I’m hunting for
        flaws, that to some degree is one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say, that for all of
        _Civil War’s_ ups and downs (mostly ups), it is both a worthy entrant into
        Marvel’s franchise, and perhaps even more importantly, it actually even addresses
        some of the problems left in _Age of Ultron_. Of course the acting is all
        above board, the primary action set-piece is just dumbfoundingly fun, and
        the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Civil
        War_ may not be my favourite superhero movie, or even my favourite MCU movie
        (I mean it also might be, I think I need to give it at least another two watches
        to be sure) but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie. By
        that, I don’t mean it accurately portrayed the events of the Marvel “Civil
        War” event from back 2006, because that’s not even close to true. What I mean
        is, there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the
        comics are. And you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you
        on the screen. A glorious, squillion dollar, two and a half hour comic book.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh
        yeah. And the new superheroes introduced in _Civil War_? They’ve got me pretty
        bloody excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n79%\\r\\n\\r\\n-_Gimly_\",\"created_at\":\"2018-06-05T11:58:16.657Z\",\"id\":\"5b167ad80e0a262dd60153f2\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-06-23T15:58:09.369Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b167ad80e0a262dd60153f2\"},{\"author\":\"tmdb44006625\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"\",\"username\":\"tmdb44006625\",\"avatar_path\":null,\"rating\":7.0},\"content\":\"The

        as The Winter Soldier. It's also overstuffed with characters and fan service.

        are portrayed as equally valid. The exploration of superhero accountability

        to see it incorporated into a grand cinematic universe. Also, Captain Zemo

        My new favourite, so far at least.\r\n\r\nWhat an absolute joy <em>''Captain
        America: Civil War''</em> is! It made 147 minutes feel like so much less.
        Great action, enthralling story, sharp humour and some impeccable use of the
        many, many characters; even introducing two new faces to the MCU. I won''t
        spoil who, but they are massive additions and I love what they give to this.\r\n\r\nIt
        gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved, there is no-one I
        wanted to see more or less of - it all felt very natural too, big kudos for
        that. Chris Evans is terrific, this is his best performance as Captain America
        thus far in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr. continues to impress, as expected.\r\n\r\nSebastian
        Stan as Bucky also sticks out, I didn''t love that character in his preceding
        appearances but in this I really did connect with his story. Anthony Mackie
        and Don Cheadle remain good fun, while Daniel Brühl plays his role very nicely.
        Elsewhere, Paul Rudd''s inclusion is amusing.\r\n\r\nThe whole film, as is
        normal in these productions, looks stunning. They are incredibly well made.
        As noted at the top, this is more new favourite from the MCU - surpassing
        <em>''Captain America: The First Avenger''</em>. I guess there''s no hiding
        who my standout avenger is, eh?\r\n\r\nThe only ''but'' I have for this is
        the title. It''s practically an avengers film. I''m not saying it''s an ill-fitting
        title, I get it''s the titular character''s arc, but I feel like it does the
        film a slight disservice - it''s impacts much more than Captain America.\r\n\r\nThat''s
        not a big deal, at all, though. No doubt in my mind: this is superb!","created_at":"2021-01-20T01:17:14.174Z","id":"6007849aaf2da8003e90594f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:50.332Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6007849aaf2da8003e90594f"},{"author":"Andre

        another super-sized Marvel Comics superhero saga hits the big screen with
        the selected savior Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee.
        Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives
        on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful
        spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout
        the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on
        the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious
        and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over
        the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed
        and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess,
        **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions
        of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by
        two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert
        Downey Jr.’s Iron Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo
        were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise
        to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more
        treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing
        the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed
        festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil
        War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis
        flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what has caused
        the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the
        world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral
        damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus
        the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers.
        Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda
        Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that
        caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head
        honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets
        in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority
        want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the
        Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll
        when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading
        the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary
        of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored
        by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes
        that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being
        placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic
        duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth
        confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor
        Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree
        that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers.
        Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother
        (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during
        an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision
        to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with
        Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision
        (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America,
        he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers
        that want to scrutinize the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America
        firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn
        top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious
        mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying
        to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan)
        who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s
        innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come
        with more baggage attached to him–mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo
        (Daniel Bruhl).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus
        and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous “Captain America: Winter
        Soldier”) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and
        effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous
        blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works
        far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic
        Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary
        of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their
        hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put
        on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive
        to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors
        not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table.
        It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our
        heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely
        destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
        movie’s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings
        especially when a who’s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray
        at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes
        of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner),
        Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman).
        No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad
        for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive
        arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’s steady and charismatic Captain
        America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title
        one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that
        lifts the profile of Evans’s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative
        big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for
        Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the
        slick and resourceful Black Panther.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, **Captain America: Civil
        War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers
        for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen
        Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Captain

        heroes're divided and so the fans!**\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore watching this I thought
        what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once
        I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain
        America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally
        inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked
        it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war
        within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration
        they want to come under.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think they have heard that people's
        complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing
        up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that
        is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing
        the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad
        guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation
        of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining
        about that be happy?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know, but as an entertaining film,
        it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and
        posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take
        a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would
        feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously
        Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United
        States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not
        like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope
        the fans won't take it seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n_8/10_\",\"created_at\":\"2016-10-04T20:21:05.083Z\",\"id\":\"57f40f319251417fe300171a\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-06-23T15:57:51.523Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/57f40f319251417fe300171a\"},{\"author\":\"Per

        I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not
        like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one
        star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want my
        heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong
        foot right away by not only “incriminating” the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit
        politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make
        matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the United
        Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie
        right away for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I though that it could not get any worse
        it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and
        fight among themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe few redeeming qualities of this movie is
        great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time
        to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided
        and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically
        there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the
        filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story

        long form review originally posted in 2016</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s commonplace
        for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a
        movie, that’s particularly true of MCU, and even more so of this particular
        film. That all said, here is my initial reaction to _Captain America: Civil
        War_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is often the case, it’s hard to write down too comprehensive
        a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free, so
        for starters, I’ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from
        about five minutes in to _Civil War_: I want to know how it is that two guys
        who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things, manage to
        direct action this spectacularly? Honestly. It’s insane.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Winter
        Soldier_ is one of the strongest MCU films in my opinion, and just like that
        felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior _Captain America_ film and
        the prior _Avengers_ film, _Civil War_ feels the same, but for the sequels
        to said films (_Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_). That said, it might
        lean a little too far on to the side of _Avengers_-sequel, and a little too
        light on the _Cap_-sequel. If you had to pick a lead here, it would be Steve
        Rogers, no mistake, but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad
        brush of characterisation to be solely a “_Captain America_” movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering
        the sheer scope of the piece, it’s amazing that the Russo brothers managed
        to get the ball rolling on _Civil War_ as well as they did. Even so, there
        are a couple of roles I felt could have been cut altogether without really
        impacting the story, and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some
        underrepresented puzzle pieces. Perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack
        of inclusion in others is because of plans for future MCU films (though certainly
        not all instances can use that excuse) but either way, if I’m hunting for
        flaws, that to some degree is one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say, that for all of
        _Civil War’s_ ups and downs (mostly ups), it is both a worthy entrant into
        Marvel’s franchise, and perhaps even more importantly, it actually even addresses
        some of the problems left in _Age of Ultron_. Of course the acting is all
        above board, the primary action set-piece is just dumbfoundingly fun, and
        the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Civil
        War_ may not be my favourite superhero movie, or even my favourite MCU movie
        (I mean it also might be, I think I need to give it at least another two watches
        to be sure) but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie. By
        that, I don’t mean it accurately portrayed the events of the Marvel “Civil
        War” event from back 2006, because that’s not even close to true. What I mean
        is, there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the
        comics are. And you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you
        on the screen. A glorious, squillion dollar, two and a half hour comic book.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh
        yeah. And the new superheroes introduced in _Civil War_? They’ve got me pretty
        bloody excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n79%\\r\\n\\r\\n-_Gimly_\",\"created_at\":\"2018-06-05T11:58:16.657Z\",\"id\":\"5b167ad80e0a262dd60153f2\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-06-23T15:58:09.369Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b167ad80e0a262dd60153f2\"},{\"author\":\"tmdb44006625\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"\",\"username\":\"tmdb44006625\",\"avatar_path\":null,\"rating\":7.0},\"content\":\"The

        My new favourite, so far at least.\r\n\r\nWhat an absolute joy <em>''Captain
        America: Civil War''</em> is! It made 147 minutes feel like so much less.
        Great action, enthralling story, sharp humour and some impeccable use of the
        many, many characters; even introducing two new faces to the MCU. I won''t
        spoil who, but they are massive additions and I love what they give to this.\r\n\r\nIt
        gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved, there is no-one I
        wanted to see more or less of - it all felt very natural too, big kudos for
        that. Chris Evans is terrific, this is his best performance as Captain America
        thus far in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr. continues to impress, as expected.\r\n\r\nSebastian
        Stan as Bucky also sticks out, I didn''t love that character in his preceding
        appearances but in this I really did connect with his story. Anthony Mackie
        and Don Cheadle remain good fun, while Daniel Brühl plays his role very nicely.
        Elsewhere, Paul Rudd''s inclusion is amusing.\r\n\r\nThe whole film, as is
        normal in these productions, looks stunning. They are incredibly well made.
        As noted at the top, this is more new favourite from the MCU - surpassing
        <em>''Captain America: The First Avenger''</em>. I guess there''s no hiding
        who my standout avenger is, eh?\r\n\r\nThe only ''but'' I have for this is
        the title. It''s practically an avengers film. I''m not saying it''s an ill-fitting
        title, I get it''s the titular character''s arc, but I feel like it does the
        film a slight disservice - it''s impacts much more than Captain America.\r\n\r\nThat''s
        not a big deal, at all, though. No doubt in my mind: this is superb!","created_at":"2021-01-20T01:17:14.174Z","id":"6007849aaf2da8003e90594f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:50.332Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6007849aaf2da8003e90594f"},{"author":"Andre

        in 1986, Aki Kaurismaki''s <i>Varjoja paratiisissa</i> (Shadows in Paradise)
        is one of the Finnish filmmaker''s earliest efforts, and it stands as one
        of the most idiosyncratic romantic comedies of all time. The painfully shy
        Nikander (Matti Pellonpää), a garbage man, means the moody Ilona, a supermarket
        checkout girl. The film tracks their bumbling attempt to establish a lasting
        relationship: dates that end as soon as they''ve begun, a romantic getaway
        where they each retreat to separate hotel rooms, and rare conversations which
        employ the absolute bare minimum of words. Nikander''s best and only friend
        Melartin (Sakari Kuosmanen), whom the garbage man only recently met through
        a spell in jail, gives some needed encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe film''s soundtrack
        is rooted in early rock-and-roll, though unlike later Kaurismaki films where
        the characters seem to be living in a 1950s bubble, all the action takes place
        in contemporary Helsinki. I''ve criticized Kaurismaki''s vision of Finland
        in other films, but <i>Varjoja paratiisissa</i> does, in my opinion, accurately
        depict the collection of gloomy, taciturn binge drinkers that are the Finns.\r\n\r\n<i>Varjoja
        paratiisissa</i> is an early work and doesn''t show the confidence of later
        efforts, but it''s still quite entertaining, its leads and their struggles
        extremely charming, and I would recommend the film. Certainly the performances
        of Pellonpää (in a typical Pellonpää role) and Outinen (who seemingly reinvents
        herself in every film) will prove quite memorable.","created_at":"2018-09-06T19:31:51.288Z","id":"5b9180a7c3a3687adc005547","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:12.193Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b9180a7c3a3687adc005547"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}'

        another super-sized Marvel Comics superhero saga hits the big screen with
        the selected savior Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee.
        Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives
        on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful
        spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout
        the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on
        the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious
        and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over
        the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed
        and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess,
        **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions
        of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by
        two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert
        Downey Jr.’s Iron Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo
        were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise
        to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more
        treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing
        the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed
        festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil
        War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis
        flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what has caused
        the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the
        world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral
        damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus
        the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers.
        Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda
        Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that
        caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head
        honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets
        in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority
        want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the
        Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll
        when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading
        the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary
        of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored
        by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes
        that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being
        placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic
        duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth
        confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor
        Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree
        that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers.
        Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother
        (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during
        an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision
        to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with
        Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision
        (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America,
        he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers
        that want to scrutinize the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America
        firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn
        top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious
        mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying
        to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan)
        who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s
        innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come
        with more baggage attached to him–mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo
        (Daniel Bruhl).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus
        and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous “Captain America: Winter
        Soldier”) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and
        effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous
        blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works
        far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic
        Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary
        of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their
        hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put
        on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive
        to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors
        not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table.
        It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our
        heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely
        destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
        movie’s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings
        especially when a who’s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray
        at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes
        of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner),
        Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman).
        No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad
        for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive
        arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’s steady and charismatic Captain
        America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title
        one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that
        lifts the profile of Evans’s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative
        big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for
        Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the
        slick and resourceful Black Panther.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, **Captain America: Civil
        War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers
        for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen
        Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Captain

        heroes're divided and so the fans!**\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore watching this I thought
        what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once
        I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain
        America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally
        inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked
        it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war
        within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration
        they want to come under.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think they have heard that people's
        complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing
        up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that
        is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing
        the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad
        guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation
        of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining
        about that be happy?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know, but as an entertaining film,
        it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and
        posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take
        a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would
        feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously
        Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United
        States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not
        like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope
        the fans won't take it seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n_8/10_\",\"created_at\":\"2016-10-04T20:21:05.083Z\",\"id\":\"57f40f319251417fe300171a\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-06-23T15:57:51.523Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/57f40f319251417fe300171a\"},{\"author\":\"Per

        I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not
        like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one
        star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want my
        heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong
        foot right away by not only “incriminating” the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit
        politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make
        matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the United
        Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie
        right away for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I though that it could not get any worse
        it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and
        fight among themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe few redeeming qualities of this movie is
        great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time
        to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided
        and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically
        there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the
        filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story

        long form review originally posted in 2016</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s commonplace
        for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a
        movie, that’s particularly true of MCU, and even more so of this particular
        film. That all said, here is my initial reaction to _Captain America: Civil
        War_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is often the case, it’s hard to write down too comprehensive
        a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free, so
        for starters, I’ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from
        about five minutes in to _Civil War_: I want to know how it is that two guys
        who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things, manage to
        direct action this spectacularly? Honestly. It’s insane.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Winter
        Soldier_ is one of the strongest MCU films in my opinion, and just like that
        felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior _Captain America_ film and
        the prior _Avengers_ film, _Civil War_ feels the same, but for the sequels
        to said films (_Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_). That said, it might
        lean a little too far on to the side of _Avengers_-sequel, and a little too
        light on the _Cap_-sequel. If you had to pick a lead here, it would be Steve
        Rogers, no mistake, but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad
        brush of characterisation to be solely a “_Captain America_” movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering
        the sheer scope of the piece, it’s amazing that the Russo brothers managed
        to get the ball rolling on _Civil War_ as well as they did. Even so, there
        are a couple of roles I felt could have been cut altogether without really
        impacting the story, and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some
        underrepresented puzzle pieces. Perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack
        of inclusion in others is because of plans for future MCU films (though certainly
        not all instances can use that excuse) but either way, if I’m hunting for
        flaws, that to some degree is one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say, that for all of
        _Civil War’s_ ups and downs (mostly ups), it is both a worthy entrant into
        Marvel’s franchise, and perhaps even more importantly, it actually even addresses
        some of the problems left in _Age of Ultron_. Of course the acting is all
        above board, the primary action set-piece is just dumbfoundingly fun, and
        the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Civil
        War_ may not be my favourite superhero movie, or even my favourite MCU movie
        (I mean it also might be, I think I need to give it at least another two watches
        to be sure) but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie. By
        that, I don’t mean it accurately portrayed the events of the Marvel “Civil
        War” event from back 2006, because that’s not even close to true. What I mean
        is, there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the
        comics are. And you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you
        on the screen. A glorious, squillion dollar, two and a half hour comic book.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh
        yeah. And the new superheroes introduced in _Civil War_? They’ve got me pretty
        bloody excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n79%\\r\\n\\r\\n-_Gimly_\",\"created_at\":\"2018-06-05T11:58:16.657Z\",\"id\":\"5b167ad80e0a262dd60153f2\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-06-23T15:58:09.369Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b167ad80e0a262dd60153f2\"},{\"author\":\"tmdb44006625\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"\",\"username\":\"tmdb44006625\",\"avatar_path\":null,\"rating\":7.0},\"content\":\"The

        are portrayed as equally valid. The exploration of superhero accountability

        My new favourite, so far at least.\r\n\r\nWhat an absolute joy <em>''Captain
        America: Civil War''</em> is! It made 147 minutes feel like so much less.
        Great action, enthralling story, sharp humour and some impeccable use of the
        many, many characters; even introducing two new faces to the MCU. I won''t
        spoil who, but they are massive additions and I love what they give to this.\r\n\r\nIt
        gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved, there is no-one I
        wanted to see more or less of - it all felt very natural too, big kudos for
        that. Chris Evans is terrific, this is his best performance as Captain America
        thus far in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr. continues to impress, as expected.\r\n\r\nSebastian
        Stan as Bucky also sticks out, I didn''t love that character in his preceding
        appearances but in this I really did connect with his story. Anthony Mackie
        and Don Cheadle remain good fun, while Daniel Brühl plays his role very nicely.
        Elsewhere, Paul Rudd''s inclusion is amusing.\r\n\r\nThe whole film, as is
        normal in these productions, looks stunning. They are incredibly well made.
        As noted at the top, this is more new favourite from the MCU - surpassing
        <em>''Captain America: The First Avenger''</em>. I guess there''s no hiding
        who my standout avenger is, eh?\r\n\r\nThe only ''but'' I have for this is
        the title. It''s practically an avengers film. I''m not saying it''s an ill-fitting
        title, I get it''s the titular character''s arc, but I feel like it does the
        film a slight disservice - it''s impacts much more than Captain America.\r\n\r\nThat''s
        not a big deal, at all, though. No doubt in my mind: this is superb!","created_at":"2021-01-20T01:17:14.174Z","id":"6007849aaf2da8003e90594f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:50.332Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6007849aaf2da8003e90594f"},{"author":"Andre
